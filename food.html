            Koshary, kushari or koshari (Egyptian Arabic: كشرى [ˈkoʃæɾi]) is Egypt's national dish and a widely popular street food.[1] It is a traditional Egyptian staple, mixing pasta, Egyptian fried rice, vermicelli and brown lentils,[2][3] and topped with chickpeas, a garlicky tomato sauce, garlic vinegar, and crispy fried onions. Sprinklings of garlic vinegar and hot sauce are optional.

History
In the Egyptian Books of Genesis,[4] the Ancient Egyptian term "Koshir" meant "Food of the rites of the Gods",[4] the Koshir was a breakfast dish that consisted of lentils, wheat, chickpeas, garlic and onions cooked together in clay pots.[4] It has been claimed that the original account of the book goes back to Manetho. However in the collected works of Manetho, no mention of Koshir could be found.[5] The word is not related to the Jewish dietary laws known as Kosher. A priest from Heliopolis described it as a food to eat after fasting on the 11th day of Pachons, a month in the ancient Egyptian calendar. Koshary is known as "The food of the Poor";[6] it consists of fried onions, lentils, rice, macaroni and a red sauce. It is somewhat related to Mediterranean cuisine, but the Egyptian dish has different ingredients and flavors, especially the local Egyptian lemon sauce, which gives it the unique taste for which the dish is popular.[7]

            The word bean and its Germanic cognates (e.g. German Bohne) have existed in common use in West Germanic languages since before the 12th century,[3] referring to broad beans, chickpeas, and other pod-borne seeds. This was long before the New World genus Phaseolus was known in Europe. With the Columbian exchange of domestic plants between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of Phaseolus, such as the common bean and the runner bean, and the related genus Vigna. The term has long been applied generally to many other seeds of similar form,[3][4] such as Old World soybeans, peas, other vetches, and lupins, and even to those with slighter resemblances, such as coffee beans, vanilla beans, castor beans, and cocoa beans. Thus the term bean in general usage can refer to a host of different species.[5]
